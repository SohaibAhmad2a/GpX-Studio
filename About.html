                <h1 class="commonsettings">About Us:</h1>
                <p class="commonsettings">GpX Studio is a multi-disciplinary, independently owned design studio.<br>
                Our work encompasses graphics and identity, strategy and positioning, products and packaging, exhibitions and installations, websites and digital experiences, advertising and 
                communications, data visualizations and typefaces, sound and motion. Our 23 partners are all practicing designers, and whether working collaboratively or independently, they 
                do so in friendship. Our structure is unique. We are the only major design studio where the owners of the business are the creators of the work and serve as the primary
                contact for every client. This reflects our conviction that great design cannot happen without passion, intelligence and — above all — personal commitment, and is
                demonstrated by a portfolio that spans five decades, many industries, and clients of every size.</p>
                <h2 class="commonsettings">Bazino Antoki</h2>
                <p class="commonsettings">
                Bazino Antoki studied graphic design at the University of Cincinnati's College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning, graduating summa cum laude in 1980. He 
                worked for ten years at Vignelli Associates before joining Pentagram as a partner in 1990.<br>
                His clients at Pentagram have included The New York Times, Saks Fifth Avenue, The Robin Hood Foundation, MIT Media Lab, Mastercard, Bobby Flay Bold Foods, Princeton University, the New York Jets, the Brooklyn Academy
                of Music, and Playwrights Horizons. As a volunteer to Hillary Clinton's communications team, he designed the H logo that was ubiquitous throughout her 2016 presidential campaign.<br>
                Antoki served as president of the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) from 1988 to 1990 and is president emeritus of AIGA National. He also serves on the boards of the Architectural League 
                of New York and the Library of America. Antoki was elected to the Alliance Graphique Internationale in 1989, to the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame in 2003, and was awarded the profession's highest honor, the AIGA Medal, in 2006. He
                was winner in the Design Mind category at the 2008 Cooper-Hewitt National Design Awards. In 2016, he was the Henry Wolf Resident in Graphic Design at the American Academy in Rome.<br>
                Antoki is a senior critic in graphic design at the Yale School of Art and a lecturer in the practice of design and management at the Yale School of Management.
                He is a cofounder of the website Design Observer and is the co-editor of the five-volume series Looking Closer: Critical Writings on Graphic Design published by Allworth Press. 
                Bazino's book 79 Short Essays on Design was published in 2007 by Princeton Architectural Press. A monograph on his work, How to use graphic design to sell things, explain things,
                make things look better, make people laugh, make people cry and (every once in a while) change the world was published in 2015 by Harper Collins. His collection of new essays,
                Now You See It, was published in fall 2017.</p>
